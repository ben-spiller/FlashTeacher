# FlashTeacher
FlashTeacher is a desktop application for learning answers to questions, for example language vocabulary, or musical theory Q&As. 

Features:

* Keeps track of both mistakes and time taken to answer each question, and ensures that questions with lower scores are asked more frequently.
* Keeps track of when each question was last asked, to ensure no question is neglected for a long time.
* Has full support for incrementally increasing the corpus of questions as knowledge improves; newly questions are asked repeatedly until they are learned, before moving on to other new questions.
* Includes a score to show performance compared to last time, and a motivating graph showing increase of knowledge over time (factoring in both how well you know the questions and how big the question corpus is).
* Supports right-left-languages and any UTF-8/international character.  
* Uses Java 8. Includes an executable launcher for Windows.

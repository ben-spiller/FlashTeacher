	<!-- 
		General tips on solfege training: the best way to learn these is to get really good with a small number 
		of notesPerQuestion (e.g. 2 or 3) and a reduced set of solfegeValues then gradually increase it once you've got the basics.
		
		Ear training only works if you concentrate fully while doing it - this is the mental equivalent of 
		weight-lifting, so if you don't feel like it's something of a struggle you probably aren't stretching yourself enough to 
		keep your brain in rapid learning mode (a bit like weight-training with 1kg weights). 
		Time to change it up and increase the challenge!
		
		If you end up in a plateau where progress hasn't improved for a week/5-7 sessions or more, 
		don't just keep going with the same approach! 
		
		Instead, reflect on what is going wrong, analyze what could be holding you up and brainstorm ways to fix it. 
		If unsure, just change something - anything! e.g. make the exercise easier (so you're not totally confused), or 
		actually make the exercise harder (e.g. adding more solfege notes) to challenge the brain to go 
		back into fast-learning mode; you might end up fixing your current block automatically as a result of learning 
		the new material! Even changing something as random as the room you sit in while practicing has 
		been shown by science to measurably improve learning outcomes(!). Look up "contextual interference" to 
		find out more!

		<!-- The number of additional random notes to play after each question. 
	
		This is useful for improving the ability to recognize one or more notes 
		without being confused by following notes (which will begin to fill up your working memory). 
		Accurately recognizing the first note when followed by some random ones is a good skill 
		to build in isolation with notesPerQuestion=1 before increasing notesPerQuestion and setting
		additionalRandomNotes=0. You want to be able to instantly recognize that first note and not 
		have to stop and think about it - doing that with the interference

		<!-- Optional drone that continually plays "do". Must be an instrument like organ or singing that 
		doesn't die away. Leave blank for none. 
		
		Turning this on temporarily may help you to make progress until you can remember the "do" tonic 
		automatically, at which point you should turn it off to create a more realistic test.

		<!-- How long to play each note for. Either a single value or a range "min-max".

		When you're beginning to find it too easy, use shorter durations and/or a bigger range of durations.

		<!-- The absolute pitch or pitches to use for the base note "do" - you may wish to customize this based on your singing range.
		 
		Specify this using scientific pitch notation (e.g. C4 = middle C; for accidentals use flats e.g. Eb3). 
		Either a single value or a range "min-max" (inclusive), in which case the do note is randomly selected 
		at the start of each question session.

		<!-- A comma-separated list of MIDI instruments to use (substring, case insensitive).

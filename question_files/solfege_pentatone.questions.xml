		<!-- Use comma e.g. "ti," to indicate solfege in a lower octave and apostrophe e.g. "re'" to indicate higher octave. 
		
		Note that one additional solfege will be displayed above/below the question range, to help when you later add additional notes. 
		
		Hint: the best way to learn these is to get really good with a small number of notesPerQuestion (e.g. 2 or 3) 
		and a reduced set of solfegeValues then gradually increase it once you've mastered the basics.

		<!-- The absolute pitch or pitches to use for the base note "do" - you may wish to customize this based on your singing range.
		 
		Use scientific pitch notation (e.g. C4 = middle C; for accidentals use flats e.g. Eb3).

		at the start of each question session.
